## Core Architecture Analysis

### 1. Digital Vinyl Emulation Techniques

#### Timecode Processing Engine
The heart of xwax's vinyl emulation lies in its sophisticated timecode processing:

```c
struct timecoder {
    struct timecode_def *def;
    double speed;
    bool forwards;
    struct timecoder_channel primary, secondary;
    struct pitch pitch;
    bits_t bitstream, timecode;
    unsigned int valid_counter, timecode_ticker;
};
```

**Key Innovations:**
- **Dual-channel timecode analysis** with primary/secondary channel processing
- **LFSR (Linear Feedback Shift Register)** for timecode generation and validation
- **Real-time pitch detection** using predictive filtering algorithms
- **Multiple timecode standards** support (Serato, Traktor, Pioneer, MixVibes)

#### Timecode Definitions Supported
```c
static struct timecode_def timecodes[] = {
    {
        .name = "serato_2a",
        .resolution = 1000,     // bits per second
        .bits = 20,             // timecode bit length
        .seed = 0x59017,        // LFSR initial value
        .taps = 0x361e4,        // LFSR tap positions
        .length = 712000,       // total timecode length
        .safe = 707000,         // safe playback area
    },
    // ... Pioneer, Traktor, MixVibes variants
};
```

### 2. Audio Format Support Architecture

#### External Audio Import System
xwax uses an elegant external process approach for audio format support:

```bash
# /xwax-import script
case "$FILE" in
*.cdaudio)
    exec cdparanoia -r `cat "$FILE"` -
    ;;
*)
    exec ffmpeg -v 0 -i "$FILE" -f s16le -ac 2 -ar "$RATE" -
    ;;
esac
```

**Benefits for DJ Universe:**
- **Format agnostic**: Delegates to FFmpeg for universal format support
- **Process isolation**: Audio decoding crashes don't affect main application
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new formats or optimize specific codecs
- **Standard output**: Provides consistent 16-bit stereo PCM stream

#### Track Memory Management
```c
#define TRACK_MAX_BLOCKS 64
#define TRACK_BLOCK_SAMPLES (2048 * 1024)  // ~43 seconds at 48kHz
#define TRACK_PPM_RES 64                    // Peak meter resolution
#define TRACK_OVERVIEW_RES 2048            // Waveform overview resolution

struct track_block {
    signed short pcm[TRACK_BLOCK_SAMPLES * TRACK_CHANNELS];
    unsigned char ppm[TRACK_BLOCK_SAMPLES / TRACK_PPM_RES];
    unsigned char overview[TRACK_BLOCK_SAMPLES / TRACK_OVERVIEW_RES];
};
```

### 3. C-based Audio Processing Architecture

#### Real-time Audio Pipeline
```c
struct device_ops {
    ssize_t (*pollfds)(struct device *dv, struct pollfd *pe, size_t z);
    int (*handle)(struct device *dv);
    unsigned int (*sample_rate)(struct device *dv);
    void (*start)(struct device *dv);
    void (*stop)(struct device *dv);
    void (*clear)(struct device *dv);
};
```

**Design Patterns for DJ Universe:**
- **Polymorphic device interface**: Abstract audio backend (ALSA/OSS/JACK)
- **Poll-based I/O**: Non-blocking audio processing using epoll/select
- **Modular design**: Clean separation between audio hardware and processing
- **Real-time safety**: Memory allocation avoided in audio callbacks

#### Pitch Detection Algorithm
```c
#define ALPHA (1.0/512)    // Position filter coefficient
#define BETA (ALPHA/256)   // Velocity filter coefficient

static inline void pitch_dt_observation(struct pitch *p, double dx) {
    double predicted_x = p->x + p->v * p->dt;
    double predicted_v = p->v;
    double residual_x = dx - predicted_x;
    
    p->x = predicted_x + residual_x * ALPHA;
    p->v = predicted_v + residual_x * BETA / p->dt;
    p->x -= dx; // relative to previous
}
```

### 4. Linux Audio System Integration

#### ALSA Integration
```c
int alsa_init(struct device *dv, const char *name,
              unsigned int rate, unsigned int buffer_time);
```

#### JACK Integration
```c
#ifdef WITH_JACK
int jack_init(struct device *dv, const char *name);
#endif
```

#### OSS Support
```c
#ifdef WITH_OSS
int oss_init(struct device *dv, const char *name, unsigned int rate,
             int oss_buffers, int oss_fragment);
#endif
```

**Lessons for DJ Universe:**
- **Conditional compilation**: Build system supports multiple audio backends
- **Runtime detection**: Graceful fallback between audio systems
- **Low-latency optimization**: Buffer size tuning per audio system
- **Professional routing**: JACK integration for pro audio workflows

### 5. Turntablism and Vinyl Control Features

#### Deck Control System
```c
struct deck {
    struct device device;        // Audio I/O
    struct timecoder timecoder;  // Vinyl position tracking
    struct player player;        // Audio playback engine
    const struct record *record; // Track metadata
    struct cues cues;           // Cue point management
    double punch;               // Punch in/out position
    bool protect;               // Protect against accidental operations
};
```

#### Advanced Turntablism Features
- **Needle drop detection**: Instant position tracking from vinyl drops
- **Scratch responsiveness**: Sub-millisecond response to direction changes
- **Pitch bend accuracy**: Precise speed variations following vinyl manipulation
- **Reverse playback**: Seamless backward audio playback
- **Cue point system**: Multiple cue points with punch in/out functionality

### 6. MIDI Controller Integration

#### Controller Abstraction
```c
struct controller_ops {
    int (*add_deck)(struct controller *c, struct deck *deck);
    ssize_t (*pollfds)(struct controller *c, struct pollfd *pe, size_t z);
    int (*realtime)(struct controller *c);
    void (*clear)(struct controller *c);
};
```

#### Novation Dicer Support
```c
#ifdef WITH_ALSA
if (dicer_init(c, &rt, argv[1]) == -1)
    return -1;
#endif
```
