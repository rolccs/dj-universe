[ Description ]
Quantum VJ HD is a simple glitch-style audio visualizer (video generator). 
It can receive sound from the microphone or from the Line-in port (depends on the system settings). 
Sound will be converted to the graphic elements byte by byte. The final video can be mixed with the camera stream in real time.
Based on the algorithms from the Quantum VJ (pendant): http://warmplace.ru/hard/qvj
This app is free for all systems, except the Android and iOS.
Limitations:
 * camera is not supported in Windows and macOS versions;
 * video recording is not available in iOS version;
 * size of the resulting video file may be very big on some systems (Linux, Windows, OS X, old Android devices).
